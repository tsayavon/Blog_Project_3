# Spy x Family Blog
I decided to make a blog but I couldn't just make one without a theme!

# Intoduction
Since Spy x Family has been released, I've been a huge fan of it and decided to make it as a Blog theme because lets face it a blog without a theme is not fun. Although, I do like the simple minimalistic themes, it doesn't hurt to add a little something to make it aesthetically better. This blog can be used as a portfolio or even a personal blog.
